## Introduction

The Motor Survey System is designed to manage motor insurance claims efficiently. The system has two primary roles: the **Surveyor** and the **User**. Users initiate claims, surveyors conduct surveys and submit reports, and users or employees approve the surveys.

- **Surveyor Side**:
  - Receive and view assigned claims.
  - Conduct surveys and submit reports.
  - Update the status of claims.

## Architecture

The system is built using the following technologies:

### ASP.NET Framework
- **Backend**: .NET Framework
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Web Forms
- **Database**: Oracle Database
- 
### ASP.NET Core
- **Backend**: .NET Core
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Razor Pages / MVC
- **Database**: Oracle Database

### Angular
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: .NET Core
- **Database**: Oracle Database
 
## Implementations

### [ASP.NET Framework](dotnet-framework/README.md)

The ASP.NET Framework version uses the .NET Framework for the backend, ASP.NET Web Forms for the frontend, and Oracle Database.

### [ASP.NET Core](dotnet-core/README.md)

The ASP.NET Core version uses the .NET Core framework for the backend, ASP.NET Razor Pages or MVC for the frontend, and Oracle Database.

### [Angular](angular/README.md)

The Angular version uses Angular for the frontend, with the backend implemented in .NET Core and Oracle Database.
